#### How would change of the starting fare of taxi ride will affect the sales?

#### Assumptions
- The drop in the starting fee will attract new passengers
- The final revenue will be increased due to the increase of passengers

#### Model
- in order to predict the sales, we need to predict the multipers caused by the starting price drop
- Number of customers = a + b1*kilometer_per_ride* + b2*starting_fee* + b3*weather_condition* + b4*drivers_working_hours* + (b5*rout_covered*)
